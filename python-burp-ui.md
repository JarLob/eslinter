# Creating Burp Extension UIs in Python
No existing tutorial, I need to learn how to do it by reading other people's
code and optionally create my own tutorial.

Seems like using Jython Swing is the way to go.

## Java Tutorial
Not really useful for us:

* https://blog.secarma.com/labs/using-netbeans-gui-designer-to-make-pretty-burp-extenders

## Telewreck
Simple UI

## Laconic Wolf
Good tutorials.

### Simple message tab
Search for `Create a message tab and access the HTTP headers` to get past the
setup.

* https://laconicwolf.com/2018/04/13/burp-extension-python-tutorial/

### UI Tutorial
Search for `This tab doesnâ€™t have any features yet` and start there.

Probably the best tutorial for creating UIs in Python. Lots of explanations.

### Context Menu

## Burp Suite Extension Framework - Possibly Outdated
Nice Example of Pages and Tabs. Seems like a framework to read code and
~~steal~~ learn.
